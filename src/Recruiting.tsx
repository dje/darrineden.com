        <p>Hello,</p>
        <p>Thank you for reaching out. My apologies for this canned response. Out of respect for your time I'd like to share some points to help self-select which conversations should move forward:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>My salary is currently in the $200k to $300k range. Opportunities with a significant social good mission are an exception to this requirement. Equity as part of total compensation is a separate conversation.</li>
            <li>I believe "leetcode" (puzzle style) performative coding is a poor predictor of on-the-job performance. Instead it selects those who have managed their performance anxiety and have time to practice. I'm searching for companies thinking beyond this gatekeeping mechanism. Let's analyze an open-source project or debug a challenging problem instead.</li>
            <li>I live in Portland, Oregon and I'm not considering relocation. I've worked remotely for the majority of my career.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you'd still like to learn more about me please schedule an introductory phone call via my <a href="https://calendly.com/darrin-eden/introduction">calendar</a>. Please review my <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/darrineden/Darrin_Eden_Resume.pdf">resume</a> ahead of time. Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,<br />Darrin Eden</p>
