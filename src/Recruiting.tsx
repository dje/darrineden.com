        <p>Hello,</p>
        <p>Thank you for reaching out. My apologies for this canned response. Out of respect for your time I'd like to share some facts to help self-select which conversations should move forward:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>My salary is in the $200k to $300k range. I am not considering salaries below this band.<br />Equity as part of total compensation is a separate conversation.</li>
            <li>I believe "leetcode" (puzzle style) perfomative coding steps are a poor predictor of overall on-the-job performance. Instead it selects for those with time to practice and managed performance anxiety. I'm searching for companies thinking beyond this gatekeeping practice. Let's analyze an open-source project or debug a challenging problem instead?</li>
            <li>I am only considering remote or Portland, Oregon.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you'd still like to learn more about me after understanding this baseline please schedule an introductory phone call via my <a href="https://calendly.com/darrin-eden/introduction">calendar</a>. Please review my <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/darrineden/Darrin_Eden_Resume.pdf">resume</a> ahead of time. Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,<br />Darrin Eden</p>
