This is my personal site. I use it to play with technologies I'm curious about.

At the moment this includes [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/),  
[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), and 
[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

## Development

Requirements for development include `aws`, `npm`, and `terraform`.

To prepare a development environment run:

`make dev`
